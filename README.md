## what's a leetRoute?

leetRoute picks your route based on criteria ***you*** set, optimizing for the driving experience rather than just the fastest path. Configure your ideal drive with:

- **Number of turns** - more turns, more fun
- **Maximum turn radius** - find those tight corners (or not!)
- **Number of straightaways** - overtake that kia soul bro
- **Highest average speed limit** - vroom
- **...and more!**

## current status

leetRoute is actively being developed! A demo is live at [leetroute.vercel.app](https://leetroute.vercel.app) with basic routing and export functionality.
This is a working preview of the UI and engine - the ***Super-Cool Route Optimization-otron*** (SCRO) is coming soon.

## current features

### route preview
- Built-in map viewer to preview your route
- Google Maps URLs for familiar navigation

### export formats
Once calculated, export your custom route to:
- **GPX** (GPS Exchange) - Universal GPS format
- **KML** (Keyhole Markup Language) - For Google Earth and Maps
- **JSON** - Complete route data from the engine (for the nerds out there 🤓)

## stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask (with Jinja2 templating) (yea yea i know)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Location Services**: Photon Geocoding API
